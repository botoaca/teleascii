# Have you ever wanted to watch an animation in a terminal at an abnormally small resolution?
## Me neither! But now, you can do it!

In glorious black & white **OR** TRUE COLOR, you can now watch your FAVORITE videos right in your terminal*!

### Usage:
**For the json generator**:
* run `py gen.py -i <path_to_input_file> -m <0/1>` in the `/gen/` directory
<br />*(`-m 1` = color mode, `-m 0` = black and white mode)*

**For the main program**:
* run `make` in the `/program/` directory
* run the program with `.\build\output.exe <path_to_input_file> <resolution> <frametime_ms>`
<br />*(`40ms` as frametime = `25fps`)*

### There are two samples provided: one for black & white and the other for color mode. Here's an example:
